# Dummy-Products

Project to do call outs to external api service and get products to persist in bbdd. It allows insertions of one/multiple products. It also requires authentification to do before actions.

## Usage
* Deploy apex classes in your org. 
* Instantiate DummyProductsCallOuts class with two parameters, name and username. For testing use username: emilys and password: emilyspass.
* Execute method getSessionCredentials (if you donÂ´t do that not allow get products). 
* Execute getOneProducts (for persist one object) or getAllProducts (for persist all products). Both action in same transaction are not allowed.
* One/Multiple objets are stored in bbdd (Note that duplicates product are not persisted).
  
## EXAMPLE TO EXECUTE FROM ANONIMOUS WINDOW 

DummyProductsCallOuts dPC = new DummyProductsCallOuts('emilys' , 'emilyspass');

dPC.getSessionCredentials();

dPC.getOneProducts();

//dPC.getAllProducts();
